# NIARC 2018

## Usage Guides

### 010-Documentation

Stuff in here is written documentation for various modules/software and shit. AHHAHAHa no one will ever use this but I can hope. 

### 020-Libraries

Stuff in here is designed to be used as a library. Stuff here should be stuff that can be used between different iterations of the robot. For example, lidar code can go in here because it will not change even if we change how the robot will move. Putting code here means that we won't have a separate copy for each new project that we make. 

### 030-Software

These projects are designed to be functional tests of the robot. 

### 040-Testing

To try and keep the other folders clean. Please put everything in here that isn't complete/just for testing.
